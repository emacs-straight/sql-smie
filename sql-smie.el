;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides SMIE support for SQL-mode.
;;
;; It is currently quite inferior to `sql-indent' at indenting SQL code because
;; it only handles a tiny subset of the SQL language, so don't bother trying it
;; out for that purpose unless you're interested in improving it.
;;
;; To make use of it, you can do something like:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'sql-mode-hook #'sql-smie-enable)
;;
;; It can be used together with `sql-indent', where `sql-indent' takes care
;; of indenting and `sql-smie' is used for navigation, auto-fill, blink-paren,
;; etc...
